# React App Boilerplate

## Integration with Firebase and Redux

By concept, I mean that you have the containers in one folder, the components in another one, as well as actions and reducers.

Further improvement would be structuring it by Screens(Views), where you have a folder Screens/MainPage.js which would be a file component set of components.

Another alternative would be by feature. Because that is the core purpose of React, we have to consider that everytime we create a component, it needs to be reusable in some way. These files should not be not dependent from action creators or containers. 

```
yarn install
yarn init
```
